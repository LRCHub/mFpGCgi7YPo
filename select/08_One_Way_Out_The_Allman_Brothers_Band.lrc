[01:02.22] Ain't but one way out, baby, Lord I just can't go out that door
[01:11.59] Ain't but one way out, baby and Lord I just can't go out that door
[01:20.47] 'Cause there's a man down there might be your man, I don't know
[01:51.97] 
[01:29.85] Lord you got me trapped woman up on the second floor;
[01:34.64] If I get by this time I won't be trapped no more
[01:39.51] So raise your window, baby and I can ease out soft and slow
[01:47.65] And lord, your neighbors, no they won't be
[01:50.60] Talking that stuff that they don't know
[02:10.10] 
[03:35.08] Lord, I'm foolish to be here in the first place
[03:39.86] I know some man gonna walk in and take my place
[03:44.78] Ain't no way in the world I'm going out that front door
[03:52.54] 'Cause there's a man down there might be your man, I don't know
[04:01.38] 'Cause there's a man down there might be your man, I don't know
[04:10.52] 'Cause there's a man down there,
[04:26.52] 
[04:13.95] Lord, it just might happen to be your man
[04:19.56] Lord, it just a might be your man
[04:22.71] Mmm-mm-mmm-mm...
[04:27.95] Lord, it just a might be your man
[04:32.65] Oh baby, Lord, I just don't know...
